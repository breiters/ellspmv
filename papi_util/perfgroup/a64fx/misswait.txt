# L1/L2_MISS_WAIT:
# Amalgamated value of the number of in-flights per cycle in L1/L2 cache miss
# processing (i.e., value obtained by integrating the number of used MIBs of
# the L2 cache for each cycle)
L1_MISS_WAIT
L2_MISS_WAIT

Formulas:

# Average latency of L1D/L2 cache miss processing:
Avg latency of L1D miss processing [cycles/miss] = L1_MISS_WAIT / L1D_CACHE_REFILL
Avg latency of L2 miss processing [cycles/miss] = L2_MISS_WAIT / (L2D_CACHE_REFILL - (L2D_SWAP_DM + L2D_CACHE_MIBMCH_PRF))

# Average number of outstanding misses in L1D/L2 cache miss processing:
Avg # outstanding L1D cache misses [ ] = L1_MISS_WAIT / CPU_CYCLES
Avg # outstanding L2 cache misses [ ] = L2_MISS_WAIT / CPU_CYCLES
