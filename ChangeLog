	* ellspmv.c: add option for separating diagonal and offdiagonal
	entries, which is a common trick that may improve SpMV
	performance.

	also, print a range of throughput, where the minimum is based on
	loading column vector entries only once, whereas the maximum is
	based on loading column vector entries every time. (This is a
	measure of effective throughput and does not account for entire
	cache lines of column vector entries being loaded and some of
	those values not being used. The true throughput of data traffic
	in the memory hierarchy may be even higher than the effective
	throughput due to loading entire cache lines at a time rather than
	single column vector entries.)
